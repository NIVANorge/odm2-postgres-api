# ODM2 controlled vocabularies

These json files are controlled vocabularies defined in external API http://vocabulary.odm2.org/. The files are downloaded by script [download_cvs.py](../download_cvs.py) and should not be edited manually. Any edits would be overwritten when running this script.

The procedure is to manually run script when we want to update and check into git.
